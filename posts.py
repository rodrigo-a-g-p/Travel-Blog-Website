            off my head that all these vanity projects are inspired by a north-american architectural standard. And then it occurs to me. Don't these
            people know the cultural heritage of their own religion? One does not need to look beyond the Indo-Gangetic Plain with cities such as Delhi, Agra, and Lahore (in Pakistan)
            to see the splendor of the Indo-Iranian mixture that is Mughal Architecture. Nowhere in the world have I seen better-looking buildings than those built by the Mughals
            in India (and Pakistan). The best part is that Mughal architecture is just the tip of the iceberg...
            Some of the most notable Indian architectural feats you should check out: Red Fort, Taj Mahal, Humayun's tomb (the previous three are Mughal),
            Kornak Sun Temple, Ellora Caves, Hampi, Rani Ki Vav, Sanchi Stupa, Hawa Mahal, Jal Mahal, Golden Temple (in Amritsar), and the Sri Ranganatha Swamy Temple.""",

            In many ways, from the european perspective, referring to the pre-columbian American Continent as a "New World" is not so much hyperbolic as
            it is accurate - the flaura was different, the fauna was different, the landscapes were different, the people and their languages, and religions,
            and traditions were different. No other country in the Americas epitomises this more than Mexico - home of some of the most fascinating and mysterious
            civilisations not just in the Americas, but in the entire world, including the Olmecs, Maya, Zapotecs, Teotihuacan, Toltecs, and Aztecs, just to name a few.
            The best part? Unlike many other countries in the Americas who shun their pre-columbian history and heritage, Mexico takes pride in it and embraces it,
            particularly that of the Aztecs. So much so that renowned Mexican writer, Octavio Paz, has criticized the National Museum of Anthropology
            in Mexico City for making the Mexica (Aztec) hall central, to the detriment of the history from other parts of the country, saying that the
            "exaltation and glorification of Mexico-Tenochtitlan transforms the Museum of Anthropology into a temple". I get his point, but I cannot blame the

            After the fall of the Mexica empire, the Spanish set out to destroy Tenochtitlan and rebuild a new city according to their own vision.
